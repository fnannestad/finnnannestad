_"I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees" ― Henry David Thoreau_

## A brief history of man's love for nature

Appreciation for the natural world may be innate in mankind, but leaving the creature comforts of our homes to get outdoors for pleasure alone is a more recent phenomenon.

Trails such as Camino de Santiago in Spain or Kumano Kodō in Japan have histories stretching back more than a millennium, however their journeyers were pilgrims, for whom the natural was secondary to the spiritual.

It was not until all the way into the late 18th and early 19th centuries that hiking as a leisure activity in-and-of itself emerged. In this time the industrial revolution had rapidly driven a wedge between everyday life and the outdoors. Forests and meadows replaced with slag heaps and smoke stacks. Naturally a reaction sprung up to this which was the artistic and literary movement we now refer to as Romanticism.

The Romanticists, initially emerging in Germany and England, rejected the Enlightenment focus on science, reason and objectivity, instead emphasising emotion, imagination and of course, the beauty of nature.

## The sublime

In 2018 I visited an exhibition named "[Wanderlust](https://www.smb.museum/en/exhibitions/detail/wanderlust/)"\* in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin, featuring several famous works from many German Romantic artists.

Two pieces that have stuck in my memory were both by Caspar David Friedrich (which me, being an art philistine, was the only artist that I was previously familiar with).

<div className="text-center">
	_Casper David Friedrich - Der Mönch am Meer (The Monk by the Sea)_
</div>

This piece, whether intentional or not by the artist, raises in me a sense of melancholy. Perhaps it's that it brings up the sense of insignificance and powerlessness we tend to feel when beholding the endless expanse of the ocean. The thought that, even after we head back home to the comforts of our bed, the barrage of waves against the shore never relents.

<div className="text-center">
	_Casper David Friedrich - Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer (Wanderer above
	the Sea of Fog)_
</div>

This piece I find far less melancholic and rather see the subject as a contemplative figure. Perhaps it partially represents the paradoxical idea that looking outwards at nature can be a gateway to the deep introspection.

Despite their differences there is something that unites both these works. I believe it is that both subjects, The Monk and The Wander, have within themselves evoked **the sublime**.

The sublime is [described by the Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/sublime_adj#20070036) as _"That quality in nature or art which inspires awe, reverence, or other high emotion; the great beauty of grandeur of an object, place, etc."_

Many of us have surely experienced the feeling. You're exhausted, hiking a mountain trail for hours through that far-too-common mountain weather where you can barely see the end of your nose through the clouds. However suddenly, you round a corner and there is a brief parting through which the dramatic mountain vista opens up before you. At this point your skin prickles with goosebumps and the hair on the back of your neck stands up. You have experienced the sublime.

Another German, the philosopher Immanuel Kant, spoke of the sublime in his Critique of Pure Reason:

_“Whereas the beautiful is limited, the sublime is limitless, so that the mind in the presence of the sublime, attempting to imagine what it cannot, has pain in the failure but pleasure in contemplating the immensity of the attempt”_

Kant differentiates the beautiful and the sublime by our ability of comprehension. Beauty we understand, but the sublime is vast, powerful or infinite. We can take it in, but we can't fully understand it, and this is what gives us pleasure.

_\* As a side note, the German language has an unfair reputation for being harsh and ugly. It has many beautiful words like "Wanderlust" - perhaps translated as the restless feeling of desiring to go somewhere new. Another similar example is "Fernweh", which roughly means the opposite of homesickness, that is, a longing for being somewhere far away from home._

## Literature of the outdoors

Several decades after the Germans discovered their love of nature, on the other side of the world the Americans joined the cause in what philosophers call the transcendentalist movement.
