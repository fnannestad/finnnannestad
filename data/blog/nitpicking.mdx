If there was a Nitpickers Anonymous support group, I'd be member number one.

Poorly named variables, incorrect camel-case capitalisation, typos, line breaks not in the right spot, exports that are never imported, ternary statements nested within ternary statements, functions with too many arguments - these are the things that keep me up at night.

In case you're thinking "that doesn't seem so bad, those things would bother me too", then I can assure you that for me it goes to a much deeper pathological level.

If I see someone start a single line comment without a space after the slashes `//like this` it bothers me. What sort of psychopath doesn't stylise their comments `// like this`?

God forbid I stumble across someone committing a string literal that uses a curly quote like this `â€™` (Unicode U+2019) instead of a perfectly good straight quote `'`.

You may imagine that endlessly requesting changes for such tedious trivialities is not helping me win any friends among my colleagues, and you would be right. But I hope to make the case for two points in this article:
1. That nitpicking has value
2. That with the use of some handy tools, we can automate away our nitpicking, both winning back the love of our colleagues, and making their lives easier

## Why we should all be nitpickers

Granted, making the case in defense of spending our valuable time and energy worrying about the unimportant stylistic aspects of code is hard to do.

C. Northcote Parkinson, in 1957, spoke of a concept which has since become known as the [Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), which proposes that the amount of time we tend to spend discussing a problem is inversely proportional to the importance of the problem.

He

1. Less bugs
2. Less wasted time debating trivialities
3. Consistent code and user experience
4. Easier for new starters

## How to automate it

Four tools in order of importance:
1. ESLint
2. Prettier
3. Knip
4. Editorconfig
5. tsconfig (bonus point for typescript project, and while not a tool, there is some specific configuration worth mentioning)
