If there was a Nitpickers Anonymous support group, I'd be member number one.

Poorly named variables, incorrect camel-case capitalisation, typos, line breaks not in the right spot, exports that are never imported, ternary statements nested within ternary statements, functions with too many arguments - these are the things that keep me up at night.

In case you're thinking "that doesn't seem so bad, those things would bother me too", then I can assure you that for me it goes to a much deeper pathological level.

If I see someone start a single line comment without a space after the slashes `//like this` it bothers me. What sort of psychopath doesn't stylise their comments `// like this`?

God forbid I stumble across someone committing a string literal that uses a curly quote like this `â€™` (Unicode U+2019) instead of a perfectly good straight quote `'`.

You may imagine that endlessly requesting changes for such tedious trivialities is not helping me win any friends among my colleagues, and you would be right. But I hope to make the case for two points in this article:

1. That nitpicking has value
2. That with the use of some handy tools, we can automate away our nitpicking, both winning back the love of our colleagues, and making their lives easier

## Why we should all be nitpickers

Granted, making the case in defense of spending our valuable time and energy worrying about the unimportant stylistic aspects of code is hard to do.

C. Northcote Parkinson, in 1957, spoke of a concept which has since become known as the [Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), which proposes that the amount of time we tend to spend discussing a problem is inversely proportional to the importance of the problem.

He

1. Less bugs
2. Less wasted time debating trivialities
3. Consistent code and user experience
4. Easier for new starters

## How to automate it

Four tools in order of importance:

1. ESLint
2. Prettier
3. Knip
4. Editorconfig
5. tsconfig (bonus point for typescript project, and while not a tool, there is some specific configuration worth mentioning)
6. VSCode
7. CI Pipeline
8. Precommit hooks (prettier lint-staged?)

## Prettier

It might be reasonable to ask, that in a world where ESLint has become so powerful, is there even a need for formatting tools like Prettier or dprint anymore? Why not just let ESLint do everything? Unfortunately for those of us hoping to slim down our number of dev-dependencies by one, ESLint is very much not intended to be used for formatting, to the point where the team has [deprecated all formatting rules and recommends using a dedicated code-formatter instead](https://eslint.org/blog/2023/10/deprecating-formatting-rules).

Prettier is simple, smart and popular, and is worth using in any JavaScript/TypeScript project.

While Prettier can be used with its out-of-the-box defaults and no config file, if you follow my recommendation and also use EditorConfig, it is important that you don't configure Prettier in a way that conflicts with it. Prettier is smart here, and for tabs, tab width and end-of-line will honour what is defined in an `.editorconfig` file, so you're best just leaving these values out.

Based on your preference, there are many further options which you can read about [here](https://prettier.io/docs/options). These can be added to a `.prettierrc` file. It is worth familiarising yourself with these options before working on your customer ESLint rules. Your rule of thumb should be "if Prettier can do it, then don't use ESLint". Some common examples are enforcing standards about usage of single vs double quotes or ending lines with semicolons. These are jobs for prettier.

## EditorConfig

The [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) project simply defines a file format that specifies coding styles that your IDE of choice will adhere to, [either natively](https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed) or [with the addition of a plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download) depending on your editor of choice.

Although formatters like the aforementioned Prettier have very wide support for different file types, there will inevitably crop up an example in your codebase at some point which is not supported (a couple of common examples are files like `Makefile` and `.gitignore`), so having an editor-level formatter which supports all text-based files will help maintain consistency for these edge cases.

Here is the `.editorconfig` setup I use, which you can tweak based on taste.

```shell
# Top-most EditorConfig file
root = true

[*]
end_of_line = lf # Unix-style newlines
insert_final_newline = true # Newline ending every file
trim_trailing_whitespace = true # Trim whitespace preceding newlines
charset = utf-8 # Enforce consistent character set
indent_style = tab # Matter of taste
index_size = 4 # Number of columns used for indentation
```

When an inevitable exception comes up where you have a particular file type that needs to be formatted differently, you can simply override your `[*]` config for that type. For example:

```shell
# Continuing on from example above

[*.{yaml,yml}]
index_size = 2
```

Unlike all the other tools mentioned in this article, EditorConfig, unfortunately, is not something we are able to run in our CI pipelines to fail a build if an offense occurs.

## Visual Studio Code

While there is no guarantee everyone working on your project uses VS Code, in 2025 it continues to be ubiquitous in the industry so is worth mentioning.
Making a `.vscode` directory in our project enables us to add a couple of useful files for encouraging consistency for developers.

### .vscode/extensions.json

Here we can add a list of recommended extensions for which any developer opening your project in VS Code will be prompted to install with a dialog that looks like this:

![VS Code Recommended Extension](/static/images/nitpicking/vscode_recommended_extension.webp)

Essential extensions to recommend, if you're following along with this article, are [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig), [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

```json
{
	"recommendations": [
		"dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
		"esbenp.prettier-vscode",
		"editorconfig.editorconfig"
	]
}
```

_If you want to add further extensions to `recommendations`, you can find the correct name to pass in under a value "Unique Identifier" found on the extension's marketplace page._

### .vscode/settings.json

VS Code has two sets of settings:

1. User Settings - This is your local VS Code configuration that will apply across any project that you open.
2. Workspace Settings - This applies just to the current project you have open, and is committed to source control.

We have no control over what our colleagues use for number 1, so number 2, workspace settings, is the important one.
There are many powerful configuration options we have at our disposal here, but to achieve what we are going for with this article and have all our team automatically format with Prettier and lint with ESLint on save, we must at least have the following in `settings.json`.

```json
{
	"editor.formatOnSave": true,
	"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
	"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
		"source.fixAll.eslint": true
	}
}
```
