# Finn Nannestad's Website

My personal website, based off [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

Please note, that if you are using Windows, you may need to run:

```bash
$env:PWD = $(Get-Location).Path
```

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Edit the layout in `app` or content in `data`. With live reloading, the pages auto-updates as you edit them.
